# divide-and-conquer
- recursively breaks down a problem into smaller problems called the sub-problems
- make sure the sub-problems become small enough to be able to solved directly (at this moment I am not sure how easy a sub-problem should be, to be able to solved **directly**)
- finally combine the solved sub-problems to form the final solution of the original problem
