# Problem
## Mimimum of Wave

- You are given an array 𝐴 of size 𝑛. 𝐴 starts with 𝐴[1] = 0, increases to the maximum, then decreases to the minimum, and increases again and finally gets back to 𝐴[𝑛] = 0. The shape of the array is then like a single wave. For example, 𝐴 = [0; 2; 5; 8; 4; 3; 1;-3;-5;-2; 0] is such an array but 𝐴 = [0; 3;-2; 6;-3; 0] is not.

- Describe a D&Q algorithm to find the minimum of the array. Assume
that all numbers in A are distinct; some are positive and some are negative
