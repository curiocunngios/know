# Finding the last 0:
You are given an array $A[1. . n]$ that contains a sequence of 0 
followed by a sequence of 1 (e.g., 0001111111). $A$ contains at least 
one 0 and one 1.


(1) Design an $O(\log n)$-time algorithm that finds the position $k$ of 
the last 0, i.e., $A[k]$ = 0 and $A[k + 1]$ = 1.

# Solution
