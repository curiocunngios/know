## Content

Before mid: CDQ,all types of sorting
After mid: Greedy, stable matching,DP, graph,BFS,DFS, MST,max flow,.......
It is the basic algorithm of computer science, the course explains all these clearly. If you want to learn deep into algorithm, it can be of great help.

## Teaching
Prof Cheng speaks not fast so he can explain everything clearly. He also gave a lot of examples in the course.

## Grading

10% Quiz in class (70% to get full)  
25% Hw ( 4 assingment in total)  
30% Mid  
35% Final  
Mid:  
Mean: 23.77   Median: 23.5 High: 44  
UQ: 29.38 Low: 0      LQ: 19  
Final:   
Mean: 40.7   Median: 42 High: 74  
UQ: 54 Low: 0    LQ: 29  

I never took part in NOIP in high school. But I once took part in Maths Olympic in high school so I found it easy, I got 36.5 in mid and 69 in final, overall is over 89 but not get 90. However I still get A+. If you were once an OIer, I advise you to take 3711H.

## Workload

Not too large. Each Hw contains about 4-5 questions and you really needs to write and think a lot, but he left a long time for you to do the Hw. There is also a problem set provided (over 70 pages).If you want to get good grades, work hard and do more exercise! （ In fact I just did the Hw lol) The key thing to get good grade is to understang the implement and basic ideas of the algorithms and all the problems are similiar.

### Summary 
- work hard 
- do more exercise
- understand the implementations of algorithms
- understand the key ideas of algorithms
- all the problems are similar 

# Make entropy
## Content

The contents are an excellent starting point to start prepping for job interviews. It starts from the basics such as different sorting methods, heap, greedy, and gradually moves to more advanced topic such as dynamic programming, then it gets easier after that as it gets to graph theory.

## Teaching

Cheng Siu wing's teaching is incredible. He dives deep into the details, but sometimes it gets hard to follow. I suggest that you read the lecture material before attending the lecture, otherwise your attention span will drive you away from the lecture :)

## Grading

When I enrolled this course I thought I would get really bad grades(like C+), but after taking the midterm, I realized that the exams are not that far of from the lecture materials. Yes it is hard, but as long as you understand the slides, do the homework, you should be fine. I got (A+) in the end :)

## Workload

There are 4 homework and it takes some time to do. But most of them are from the materials taught in class, you just need to match the problem such that it can be solved using the known algos in class.

### Summary
- understand slides
- do homework

## Content

内容大概有几个板块：divide and conquer(其中包含各种经典的排序和数据结构)，greedy和DP（动归），graph。都很重要且很有用。
不过3711H的内容更多更豪华。时间一定内容更多，自然分配给每一块内容的思考就会变少，最后的效果不一定比非H好。两者选择仁者见仁，智者见智

## Teaching

英伦口音，但腔调很平淡。幸好上课内容偏难，不然容易睡觉。
不过逻辑和对复杂问题的解释都非常好，比yike讲的好（yike属于高估学生智商的讲法）。

## Grading

老好人了，给龟超好。

midterm: 63/80, mean 45, median 46, high 78, uq 55
final: 64/100, mean 40.5, median 42, high 80, uq 51.
Letter: A+.

了解到mean和uq之间的最后拿了A-，uq附近一定会有A。

## Workload

平时作业还是有点难的，每一道都是leecode的hard，一共四次作业，每一次都得花两三天的大块时间。
考试就跟天书一样，基本上能做对一半就是很好的了。
不过这是学算法的必经之路，这种workload是合理的。

### Summary
- homeworks are hard (leetcode hard)
- exams are hard too
  - it's good to even just be able to finish half of it

Overall, it is a very comprehensive course. It is understandable that you may not be able to catch up so many contents. I know the number of contents this course has is already quite appropriate (given that I have audited Amir's 3711H, which is a fking nightmare in terms of workload). There are so much more you can learn from algorithms but unfortunately cannot be fit into 3 months of contents.

Teaching

The professor has tried hard to make the content understandable. However, I can feel she has some improvements to make, including reading less directly from slides.

According to some people I know in L1, Prof. CHENG in L1 is much more knowledgeable and better at explaining the content. Therefore, it may be better if you go to Prof. CHENG's session.

## Grading

There is an important thing to do in this course, which is to appeal! I have obtained a lot of scores from this course. To show the impact, I will also give out how much score I get from appeal/paper-checking.

Marking scheme:  
Assignments 30%  
Mid-term Exam 30%  
Final Exam 40%  

My score:  
97/100 Assignment 1  
(Mean: 92.61, LQ: 90.00, Median: 97.00, UQ: 100.00)  
66/100 -> 96/100 Assignment 2  
(Mean: 75.89, LQ: 66.00, Median: 78.00, UQ: 91.00)  
95/100 Assignment 3  
(Mean: 85.30, LQ: 80.00, Median: 92.00, UQ: 97.00)  
100/100 Assignment 4  
(Mean: 87.84, LQ: 85.00, Median: 93.00, UQ: 98.00)  
65/80 -> 75/80 Mid-term Exam  
(Mean: 52.89, LQ: 44.25, Median: 56.00, UQ: 62.00)  
87/100 -> 91/100 Final Exam  
(Mean: 58.97, LQ: 44.00, Median: 63.00, UQ: 76.00)  
From appeal: +7.6  
Overall: 93.63  
Grade: A+  

As you can see, from appealing, I have obtained 7.6 score higher in overall. You can see the importance of proper appealing. Therefore, if you believe you should be higher, you should appeal, especially hw which you may be copying from other websites

## Workload

The workload for this course is very high.

There are 4 hw assignments in this course. Each Q can take you at least a day to do (or maybe I'm just stupid). Many of the questions can be found from website, but it is best if you understand it for appeal, just in case if your TA do not understand your solution. You can see from the distribution, the mean is fking high for each of them. Try your very best on all of them. There may also be a bit more workload from the appeal. Just see attached on how I explain during appeal.

Mid-term Exam is relatively easy to revise, because they move the greedy algorithm to Final instead. As a result, they would try to find stuff to test from limited topics. Try to remember the proof of correctness and complexity as best as possible.

For the same reason, final turn out to be pretty hard to revise. Greedy algorithm, DP and graphs, there are just so much you need to memorize. But this doesn't mean you can ignore the maximum flow part. So... try your best to prepare... I lose quite a lot of marks because I forgot what max flow min cut theorem is.


### Summary
- very high workload (he got A+)
- each Q in the homework assignments can take one day to do
- try to remember the proof of correctness and complexity for midterm
- a lot to memorize for the final exam
- remember to appeal 
- present your algorithm in a better way

HARD AS HELL SORRY I AM RUBBISH

## Teaching

After attending lecture, learn nothing, Ke is just reading from slides. With some complicated and confusing extra explanations.

## Grading

I am here to say Ke's final is terrible, min/lq/median/mean/uq/max = 6/31/42/40.77/50/78 out of 100 (40%)

MT is normal = 0/37/46/45.11/55/78 out of 80 (30%)

HW is terrible... (30%)

update: I got a B (MT UQ 55/80 + Final below mean 37/100)

Workload

Homework are hell and take you several full days to complete them, you have 4...

Better don't go to lecture but goto Arman's tutorial, they are helpful.

Past paper are useless, I threw all away once after exam.

### Summary
- it's hard



# 151044
## Content

Contents are the same as any standard algorithms course.
Big-O, Theta, Omega (and the Master Theorem)
Divide and Conquer (Binary Search, Mergesort)
Randomized Algorithms (Probability, Quicksort)
Heap (and Heapsort)
Linear-time Sorting (Counting and Radix Sort)
Greedy Algorithms (Stable Marriage, Huffman Encoding)
Dynamic Programming (1D, Over intervals, 2D)
Graphs (Basic Properties, BFS, DFS)
Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's, Kruskal's)
Shortest Paths (Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall)
Maximum Flow (Briefly in 1 lecture)

Overall, pretty applicable to many problems you'll see.

## Teaching

Despite having a 9am Friday session, Siu Wing was a decent lecturer who could keep my attention and is generally easy to follow. He does tend to ask questions to students to illustrate some of the more tricky points - interactive, but perhaps not the cup of tea for everyone.

One not-so-nice thing is that he tends to skim over chapters when he doesn't have time - so I got quite confused at the last chapter on maximum flow. Overall his lectures are well-paced though, with decent examples for you to revise to.

## Grading

Grading was pretty good considering my performance.

Grading scheme was Homework 30%, Midterm 30%, and Final 40%, so good homework performance is essential.

Data (Low,LQ,Mean,Median,UQ,High,Max):
HW 1:0/38/40.27/43/47/50/50
HW 2:0/44/43.18/47/48/50/50
HW 3:0/26/29.9/33/35/40/40
HW 4:0/41.75/43.57/48/52/55/55

Midterm:11/27/35.2/34.5/42/63/70

Final:5/23.5/33.95/34/42/60/70

Scoring at or below LQ for every homework, slightly above mean in midterm, and slightly below mean in Finals yielded a B-.

Note: Siu Wing's exams are not like Golin's exams or Papadias' exams: they are nearly all pure algorithm design questions with no "dry run" questions for you to get marks, and you need to prove the correctness of your solutions as well. Prepare adequately by reviewing homework and slides to see common proof techniques for algorithms.

## Workload

The four assignments constituted the majority of the workload. Don't be fooled by the low number of questions - all of them require significant time to work out (especially the proofs). You are advised to at least read through the homework when it comes out and think about it in your spare time. Find groups to do your homework as well - some of the more difficult questions would definitely benefit from you bouncing ideas off each other.

From someone who's definitely not a math guy and got overwhelmed by the homework: it's okay if you find the homework difficult. The mean of the exams are way lower, and you can get your marks back there. Good luck!

## Summary
- assignments has high workload
- math heavy 
- Siu Wing's exam not like Golin's exam 
  - no/rarely have "dry-run" typed questions
  - nearly all pure algorithm design 
    -  correctness proof of your own solution
  - prepare by reviewing homework and slides for proof techniques

# unfortunate
## Content

More or less similar to previous semesters. NO AVL tree (although the professor promised to teach it during lectures) and string matching this semester. There isn't enough time, the professor is basically flying through max flow in the last lecture.

All algorithmic problems discussed in COMP3711 are pretty standard. The focus is in learning algorithms instead of the your problem-solving ability.

## Teaching

The teaching pace is quite slow as the professor is trying to explain a lot of details of the algorithm. Sometimes he will ask some questions that clarify the correctness of an algorithm but most of the class doesn't get what he's trying to ask which is kind of funny. (because he doesn't want to reveal too much in his conceptual questions)

He tried to make some jokes during lectures occasionally e.g., "two-child policy" in the correctness of huffman-encoding. He also repeatedly asked us to not think about algorithms during DP lecture in the course "Design and Analysis of Algorithms".

The PowerPoint of both lecture and tutorial are very-well designed like all COMP courses. The teaching of lecturer is in general good and the teaching of TA is not bad either.

## Grading

Midterm: 40/70
Final: 52.5/70
HW1-3 full
HW4: 44/55
Grade: A

## Workload

Given that I have some experience with algorithms before, the workload is average but you really have to attend lectures except if you already know the content very well.

I'm a year 1 student so I waive COMP2012/2012H to take this course. It's certainly ok for you to do so since the course has nothing to do with C++. What you need is a little bit of "mathematics sense" and a basic idea of what complexity means. I also don't think COMP2711/2711H is any helpful to this course so you may waive that as well if you are really interested in taking this algorithm course in year 1. COMP2711/2711H is more helpful for COMP5711/5712.

4 assignments throughout the semester. Some problem in assignment is quite difficult and may take you some time to figure out. On average, each assignment takes me about 5 hours to finish (most of the time is spent on formatting latex). I got almost full marks in asm1-3 except I always forgot to state the running time of some trivial algorithms. I also run binary merge tree wrong in asm4. That causes quite a lot of marks so you need to be careful and double-check your assignments since mean is usually around 80-90%.

Both mid-term and final exam is of moderate difficulty but time is quite limited. The TAs is lenient on marking though. You don't need extremely rigorous proof. I tried to give formal proofs in mid-term, ending up not having enough time to finish some easy problems.

## Summary:
- hard homework 
- limited time on exams
- marking is lenient for exams
  - don't need to be rigorous on proof
  - need to know how to proof

# mark_
## Content

- Divide and Conquer
- Random Algorithms
- Quicksort, Heapsort, Linear sort
- Greedy Algorithms, Huffman, Stable Marriage
- Dynamic programming (1D, 2D, over intervals)
- Graph Theory
- BFS, DFS, Min Spanning Tree
- Shortest path
- Max Flow

My personal suggestion is to do some algorithms practice before taking this course.

P.S. COMP3711H will be offered again next Spring by Prof. Goharshady.

## Teaching

Professor Cheng's teaching is indeed quite interesting. I think he really wants you to understand the ideas taught in class, and goes into great detail with lots of diagrams and examples. He also sometimes throws in a few jokes to keep the lecture interesting.

He will also sometimes ask the class questions and may randomly pick people, so be prepared to answer if you attend the lecture.

However, sometimes he rambles too much, so it can be hard to pay attention. It also means he sometimes has to rush to finish the remaining content (or just skip it).

The tutorials are not that useful, but it's good to review the tutorial slides before the exam.

## Grading

The grading is curved but quite reasonable.

30% Written Assignments x4
30% Midterm
40% Final
(No programming assignments)

The midterm and final are much harder than Golin's and Dimitris's, since almost all the questions involve designing an algorithm and proving it. Don't even bother doing past paper analysis; it won't help. However, in return, the letter grade is more lenient (I think the A-range is wider).

In the final exam, the marks are very sparsely spread out. However, maybe 20% of the total marks can be obtained by just reciting the lecture notes.

STATS (Prof Cheng's section only)
--
Low  LQ  Median  UQ   Max  |   Mean

Assignment 1 (/50):
0  38  43  47  50  |  40.27
Assignment 2 (/50):
0  44  47  48  50  |  43.18
Assignment 3 (/40):
0  26  33  35  40  |  29.9
Assignment 4 (/55):
0  42  48  52  55  |  43.68

Assignment mean is 157.03/195.

Midterm (/70):
11  27  34.5  42  63  |  35.2
Final (/70):
5  26  34  42.5  60 | 34.14

The overall mean is 58.75% and will get you a B-.

The A+ cutoff is <= 86% (not enough data to determine). I would guess it is around 80.

Based on other reviews, 7x% is enough for A-range.

## Workload

The majority of the workload will come from completing the four biweekly assignments.

Each assignment has 5 problems, usually with one easier problem (such as just running an algorithm or solving recurrences), 2-3 moderately hard problems, and 1-2 really hard problems. Depending on your ability, it may take anywhere from a few hours to a week to complete.

(Some questions in the assignments would be a better fit for MATH 1023 than COMP 3711...)

Certainly, I will say you should take this course with some friends or teammates. You are allowed to collaborate on assignments, so it will be good to bounce some ideas around. Some of the assignment questions are genuinely really hard.

## Summary 
- workload are on the assignments
  - 2-3 moderately hard
  - 1-2 really hard
  - Some questions in assignment is actually a better fit for MATH1023 than COMP3711
- midterm and final are much harder than Golin's and Dimitris's,
  - designing an algorithm and proving it
  - don't bother doing past papers analysis 
- 20% of the total marks can be obtained by just reciting the lecture notes.
