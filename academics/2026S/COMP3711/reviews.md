## Content

Before mid: CDQ,all types of sorting
After mid: Greedy, stable matching,DP, graph,BFS,DFS, MST,max flow,.......
It is the basic algorithm of computer science, the course explains all these clearly. If you want to learn deep into algorithm, it can be of great help.

## Teaching
Prof Cheng speaks not fast so he can explain everything clearly. He also gave a lot of examples in the course.

## Grading

10% Quiz in class (70% to get full)  
25% Hw ( 4 assingment in total)  
30% Mid  
35% Final  
Mid:  
Mean: 23.77   Median: 23.5 High: 44  
UQ: 29.38 Low: 0      LQ: 19  
Final:   
Mean: 40.7   Median: 42 High: 74  
UQ: 54 Low: 0    LQ: 29  

I never took part in NOIP in high school. But I once took part in Maths Olympic in high school so I found it easy, I got 36.5 in mid and 69 in final, overall is over 89 but not get 90. However I still get A+. If you were once an OIer, I advise you to take 3711H.

## Workload

Not too large. Each Hw contains about 4-5 questions and you really needs to write and think a lot, but he left a long time for you to do the Hw. There is also a problem set provided (over 70 pages).If you want to get good grades, work hard and do more exercise! （ In fact I just did the Hw lol) The key thing to get good grade is to understang the implement and basic ideas of the algorithms and all the problems are similiar.

### Summary 
- work hard 
- do more exercise
- understand the implementations of algorithms
- understand the key ideas of algorithms
- all the problems are similar 

# Make entropy
## Content

The contents are an excellent starting point to start prepping for job interviews. It starts from the basics such as different sorting methods, heap, greedy, and gradually moves to more advanced topic such as dynamic programming, then it gets easier after that as it gets to graph theory.

## Teaching

Cheng Siu wing's teaching is incredible. He dives deep into the details, but sometimes it gets hard to follow. I suggest that you read the lecture material before attending the lecture, otherwise your attention span will drive you away from the lecture :)

## Grading

When I enrolled this course I thought I would get really bad grades(like C+), but after taking the midterm, I realized that the exams are not that far of from the lecture materials. Yes it is hard, but as long as you understand the slides, do the homework, you should be fine. I got (A+) in the end :)

## Workload

There are 4 homework and it takes some time to do. But most of them are from the materials taught in class, you just need to match the problem such that it can be solved using the known algos in class.

### Summary
- understand slides
- do homework

## Content

内容大概有几个板块：divide and conquer(其中包含各种经典的排序和数据结构)，greedy和DP（动归），graph。都很重要且很有用。
不过3711H的内容更多更豪华。时间一定内容更多，自然分配给每一块内容的思考就会变少，最后的效果不一定比非H好。两者选择仁者见仁，智者见智

## Teaching

英伦口音，但腔调很平淡。幸好上课内容偏难，不然容易睡觉。
不过逻辑和对复杂问题的解释都非常好，比yike讲的好（yike属于高估学生智商的讲法）。

## Grading

老好人了，给龟超好。

midterm: 63/80, mean 45, median 46, high 78, uq 55
final: 64/100, mean 40.5, median 42, high 80, uq 51.
Letter: A+.

了解到mean和uq之间的最后拿了A-，uq附近一定会有A。

## Workload

平时作业还是有点难的，每一道都是leecode的hard，一共四次作业，每一次都得花两三天的大块时间。
考试就跟天书一样，基本上能做对一半就是很好的了。
不过这是学算法的必经之路，这种workload是合理的。

### Summary
- homeworks are hard (leetcode hard)
- exams are hard too
  - it's good to even just be able to finish half of it

Overall, it is a very comprehensive course. It is understandable that you may not be able to catch up so many contents. I know the number of contents this course has is already quite appropriate (given that I have audited Amir's 3711H, which is a fking nightmare in terms of workload). There are so much more you can learn from algorithms but unfortunately cannot be fit into 3 months of contents.

Teaching

The professor has tried hard to make the content understandable. However, I can feel she has some improvements to make, including reading less directly from slides.

According to some people I know in L1, Prof. CHENG in L1 is much more knowledgeable and better at explaining the content. Therefore, it may be better if you go to Prof. CHENG's session.

## Grading

There is an important thing to do in this course, which is to appeal! I have obtained a lot of scores from this course. To show the impact, I will also give out how much score I get from appeal/paper-checking.

Marking scheme:  
Assignments 30%  
Mid-term Exam 30%  
Final Exam 40%  

My score:  
97/100 Assignment 1  
(Mean: 92.61, LQ: 90.00, Median: 97.00, UQ: 100.00)  
66/100 -> 96/100 Assignment 2  
(Mean: 75.89, LQ: 66.00, Median: 78.00, UQ: 91.00)  
95/100 Assignment 3  
(Mean: 85.30, LQ: 80.00, Median: 92.00, UQ: 97.00)  
100/100 Assignment 4  
(Mean: 87.84, LQ: 85.00, Median: 93.00, UQ: 98.00)  
65/80 -> 75/80 Mid-term Exam  
(Mean: 52.89, LQ: 44.25, Median: 56.00, UQ: 62.00)  
87/100 -> 91/100 Final Exam  
(Mean: 58.97, LQ: 44.00, Median: 63.00, UQ: 76.00)  
From appeal: +7.6  
Overall: 93.63  
Grade: A+  

As you can see, from appealing, I have obtained 7.6 score higher in overall. You can see the importance of proper appealing. Therefore, if you believe you should be higher, you should appeal, especially hw which you may be copying from other websites

## Workload

The workload for this course is very high.

There are 4 hw assignments in this course. Each Q can take you at least a day to do (or maybe I'm just stupid). Many of the questions can be found from website, but it is best if you understand it for appeal, just in case if your TA do not understand your solution. You can see from the distribution, the mean is fking high for each of them. Try your very best on all of them. There may also be a bit more workload from the appeal. Just see attached on how I explain during appeal.

Mid-term Exam is relatively easy to revise, because they move the greedy algorithm to Final instead. As a result, they would try to find stuff to test from limited topics. Try to remember the proof of correctness and complexity as best as possible.

For the same reason, final turn out to be pretty hard to revise. Greedy algorithm, DP and graphs, there are just so much you need to memorize. But this doesn't mean you can ignore the maximum flow part. So... try your best to prepare... I lose quite a lot of marks because I forgot what max flow min cut theorem is.


### Summary
- very high workload (he got A+)
- each Q in the homework assignments can take one day to do
- try to remember the proof of correctness and complexity for midterm
- a lot to memorize for the final exam
- remember to appeal 
- present your algorithm in a better way

HARD AS HELL SORRY I AM RUBBISH

## Teaching

After attending lecture, learn nothing, Ke is just reading from slides. With some complicated and confusing extra explanations.

## Grading

I am here to say Ke's final is terrible, min/lq/median/mean/uq/max = 6/31/42/40.77/50/78 out of 100 (40%)

MT is normal = 0/37/46/45.11/55/78 out of 80 (30%)

HW is terrible... (30%)

update: I got a B (MT UQ 55/80 + Final below mean 37/100)

Workload

Homework are hell and take you several full days to complete them, you have 4...

Better don't go to lecture but goto Arman's tutorial, they are helpful.

Past paper are useless, I threw all away once after exam.

### Summary
- it's hard
