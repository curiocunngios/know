- The stem weights in grams were recorded after the end of 140 days. The data are given  in the table below.
- Table: stem weights in grams:

|No Nitrogen|0.32|0.53|0.28|0.37|0.47|0.43|0.36|0.42|0.38|0.43|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Nitrogen|0.26|0.43|0.47|0.49|0.52|0.75|0.79|0.86|0.62|0.46|

- Calculate 
  - sample mean
  - sample median
