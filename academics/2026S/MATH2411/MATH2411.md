# Lecture 1
## Introduction
- ### [Statistics](../../../notes/statistics.md)
- ### Key concepts in statistics:
  - Population
    - collection of all possible objects or individual of interests 
      - too large, can't deal with
  - Sample:
    - part of the population selected for analysis
      - Smaller, can deal with
  - Parameter:
    - a numerical measures computed from the population and used to describe a characteristics of the population 
      - unknown
      - what is it called parameter?
  - Statistic
    - a numerical measures computed from the sample and used to describe a characteristics of the sample
      - can compute
- ### Example 1: tossing a biased coin
  - Population
    - tossing the coin to get a head of tail
  - Sample:
    - results over just 10 tosses
  - Parameter:
    - probability of head
  - Statistics:
    - Compute from the sample
- ### Example : (monthly family spending in Hong Kong)
  - Population
    - a collection of all families in Hong Kong
  - Sample:
    - 1000 families randomly selected
  - Parameter:
    - the average monthly family spending on food in Hong Kong
  - Statistic:
    - the average monthly family spending on food of the 1000 families selected
- ### Why draw a sample:
  - impossible or impractical to examine the entire population
  - instead examine a part of it (sampmle)
    - to find out something about the population 
  - this is called making a statistical inference regarding the population
- ### Two branches of statistics:
  - **Descriptive statistics:**
    - people do:
      - data collection
      - data presentation
      - data summarisation
    - provides summary of the data using tabular or graphical summary
      - e.g. frequency table
    - Describe data using:
      - measures of central tendency (e.g. mean)
      - measures of dispersion (e.g. standard deviation)
    - helps to identify patterns and trends in the data
    - Examples:
      - frequency table
      - histograms
      - scatter plots
  - **Inferential statistics:**
    - Statistical conclusion about a population based only on the data in a sample, using:
      - probability
      - Mathematics
      - Formulas
    - use sample data to make inferences about a large population
    - tests hypothesis of a statement and make decision
    - helps to address a scientific question
    - Examples:
      - t-tests
      - ANOVA
      - linear regression
- ### Course outline (again?!)
    1. Descriptive statistics
    2. Basic probability theory
    3. Random variables, distribution,
    special random variables
    4. Point estimation, confidence interval
    5. Hypothesis testing, p-value, t-test
    6. Two sample tests, ANOVS
    7. Linear regression

    - Sample Median 
    - Sample variance 
    - Quartile 
    - Range, IQR
    - Outlier
- ### Data
  - data definition:
    - it's a collection of:
      - facts
      - measurements 
      - other forms of information
    - it's also a collection of observations of variables:
      - samples
      - data points
      - values
    - for reference and analysis 
  - data needs to be organized and summarized by:
    - Graphical ways
    - numerical ways
  - Example:
  - ![alt text](attachments/image.png)
    - each row represents measurements of a SINGLE case/patient
    - Each column refers to a characteristic of interests, called **variable**
    - each datum
      - is the value of a single variable for a single case
      - also known as **observation**
- ### Types of variables
  - **categorical**
    - Nominal
      - can't be ranked
        - e.g. dog species
        - UG majors
    - Ordinal 
      - can be ranked 
        - No. 1, 3, 8 typhoon signals
  - **Numerical**
    - Discrete
      - integer number
        - often by counting 
          - e.g. how many courses did you enroll
    - continuous
      - Real number
        - often from measurements
          - e.g. temperature
- ### Why care about types of data
  - decide how to interpret the data from the variable
    - In $R$, categorical variables are declared as **factors** and their possible values are **levels**
      ```r
      > x = c(1,2,3,4,5)
      > x
      [1] 1 2 3 4 5
      > y = as.factor(x)
      > y
      [1] 1 2 3 4 5
      Levels: 1 2 3 4 5
      ```
  - decide the appropriate statistical analysis
    - certain analyses may not be appropriate for certain data types:
      - e.g. we can't find average of categorical data
- ### data presentation (tabular and graphical summary)
  - presenting numerical data:
    - [frequency table](../../../notes/frequency_table.md)
    - histogram
    - [line chart](../../../notes/line_chart.md)
    - boxplot
  - presenting categorical data:
    - frequency table
    - pie chart
    - [bar chart (similar to historgram)](../../../notes/bar_chart.md)
