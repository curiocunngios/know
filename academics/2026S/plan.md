fuck...I want to lay down and sleep so badly....

anyways here is the plan, I have to do it. For avoiding future procrastination and getting decent grades.

## COMP3711 (4 hours max)
GOAL: level up to 3.

### What to do:
- Read --> write
  - Read lecture notes and google/gpt to read further explanation if you don't understand (40 minutes)
  - after you understood them, rewrite notes with your own words (2.5 hours)
- attempt USACO questions (1 hour)
## COMP2611
GOAL: level up to 2
### What to do:
- Read --> write
  - Read lecture notes and google/gpt to read further explanation if you don't understand (40 minutes)
  - after you understood them, rewrite notes with your own words (2.5 hours)

# general rules
- spend spare time between lectures ~~or during lecture~~ to work on math/fina notes/problems
- spend 6 hours daily (fixed) from 7 pm to 1 am to work on COMP3711 and COMP2611
- right after waking up, if you don't have lang2030, then do some algorithmic problems or comp2611 problems. (max 3 hours)
- work hard in the following order:
    - comp3711
    - comp2611
    - math2411
    - math2111
    - math2011
    - fina1303
    - lang2030


# plan 8/2/2025
## COMP3711
- ~~continue the slides, finish the first lecture note (30 minutes)~~
  - complete:
    - ~~more on worst-case analysis (1 hour)~~
    - exercise 2 and 3 (1 hour)
    - insertion sort (1 hour)
      - idea
      - runtime analysis 
    - selection sort (1 hour)
      - proof of correctness

- start usaco (1 hour)
- continue the slides, start divide and conquer slides (30 minutes)
  - write some skeleton notes to be improved later (1 hour)

## COMP2611 
- read slides (30 minutes)
  - make notes, watch the video recordings if necessary (1 hour) 

## MATH2411
- read slides (30 minutes)
  - make notes, watch the video recordings if necessary (1 hour)



# plan 11/2/2026 
- revise the stuff you learnt in todays lecture
- draw the trees 
- write the inversion counting algorithms etc. 

# Rules:
- the following is my algorithm on studying. Simply **do it** for each topics in each subject
- ## Stage 1:  basic understanding
  - make the simplest rough notes first (sometimes just directly copy lecture content)
  - ensure that you have a basic understanding while doing so
- ## Stage 2: level up
  - solve as much problems as possible on the related topics 
    - to get a better understanding 
      - first choose the problems from lecture notes, tutorial
- ## Stage 3: Simply repeat
  - move on to next topic and do the same thing above
- ## Stage 4: Final boss:
  - after doing all topics, start past papers 
- ## Stage 5: Review and embrace craftsmanship (if time is enough):
  - paraphrase the rough notes 
    - make them simple
    - make them look pretty
    - for terms that appear a lot of times
      - make bite-sized notes and link them
