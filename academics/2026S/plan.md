fuck...I want to lay down and sleep so badly....

anyways here is the plan, I have to do it. For avoiding future procrastination and getting decent grades.

## COMP3711 (4 hours max)
GOAL: level up to 3.

### What to do:
- Read --> write
  - Read lecture notes and google/gpt to read further explanation if you don't understand (40 minutes)
  - after you understood them, rewrite notes with your own words (2.5 hours)
- attempt USACO questions (1 hour)
## COMP2611
GOAL: level up to 2
### What to do:
- Read --> write
  - Read lecture notes and google/gpt to read further explanation if you don't understand (40 minutes)
  - after you understood them, rewrite notes with your own words (2.5 hours)

# general rules
- spend spare time between lectures ~~or during lecture~~ to work on math/fina notes/problems
- spend 6 hours daily (fixed) from 7 pm to 1 am to work on COMP3711 and COMP2611
- right after waking up, if you don't have lang2030, then do some algorithmic problems or comp2611 problems. (max 3 hours)
- work hard in the following order:
    - comp3711
    - comp2611
    - math2411
    - math2111
    - math2011
    - fina1303
    - lang2030
