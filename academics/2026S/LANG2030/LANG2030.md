# LANG2030 
- There are two assessment:
    - two group presentations:
        - one with individual analytical report 
        - the other one is group report

# Lecture 1
- introduction 
# Lecture 2
## Engineering ethics




## Rules of the engineers 
- they does not apply to non-engineers i.e. people without a license of being a engineer


# WFEO
- we will be using them for the report and presentations



# laws and rules 
- do not confuse laws and rules
- if an engineer fails some sort of codes, it applies only to the engineer. Not the company or other stakeholders 
  - so we can't say that "the company fails the code of ethics"

# homework 1
- turn the code of ethics formal language to spoken language number 1 and 2 


# Lecture 3
- talks a little about the report which counts into our grades
- talks about the importance of section heading
- talks about the importance of analysis
- coherences: introduction, conclusions
- use spoken language

## The Four "Ds"
- ### Describe 
  - the stakeholders
  - the fact of the case
  - causes of problems
  - what harm has been done, to be caused
- ### Determine
  - ethical issues from the case
  - how can it be defined
  - What is wrong 
  - What ethical code have b een breached
- ### Discuss 
  - options for the stakeholders
- ### Decide
  - evaluate each options
  - which options is the most ethical 
 
## Example: Roscoe's case
### Describe:
- root cause: The company is in financial trouble but still took the contract


### Stakeholders:
- Roscoe
- Roscoe's CEO
- U-Sub
- The end user: the military
- Roscoe's company's employees

### Causes likely to be done:
- The military may suffer from the unsafe torpedos 
- The reputation of Roscoe's company and U-sub might be harmed

### Ethical codes breached:
- 1.1 Refrain from fraudulent, corrupt or criminal practices
- 2.2 Practise in accordance with accepted engineering practices, standards and codes 
  - not doing the safety testing and not following this rule at all
- 4.3 Promote and protect the health, safety and well-being of the community and the
environment 
  - the fact that they are making torpedos may violate this rule

### Options available 
- refuse and resign
- report to others this legal issue (military, U-sub, etc.)
- inform the CEO for the consequences for lying
- convince the CEO to cancel the contract
- ask for financial support from other parties like the military
### Which option is the most ethical? 
- the engineering company should cancel the contract 
- the engineering company should ask for financial support

### How were the options evaluated
- whether they are **stop** the harm
  - not just removing yourself (Roscoe) from the harm

# Lecture 4 
- ### review the Roscoe's case
  - Eric asks everybody about their "graphical organizers". For example, what is their Analysis card2: Discuss (What are the options open to the stakeholders?)
- ### Analysis of the deepwater horizon incident
  - 11 died 
  - many injured 
  - it burned for 2 days 
  - because oil and gas spilled up from the sea 
  - There are three factors:
    - regulartory
    - technical
    - organisational
- ### Extract 3
- know how to find **strong language or phrases**: 
  - e.g. did not possess a functional safety culture. 
  - ### causes
    - BP did not have a functional safety culture
    - The system focused on compliance, not on the big picture of safety
    - BP failed to learn from safety warning signals
    - Imbalances between production goals and safety protections
    - Poor decisions made to save time and make money
  - ### stakeholders 
    - BP - The company and its organizations/operating teams
    - Management - Failed in decision-making and leadership
    - Regulators - Failed to provide effective oversight
    - The Industry - Failed to provide checks and balances
# Interlinked causes
- organizationl issues is like the big picture 
### Next lesson:
- Basically go through Unit 1.4
- write a short paragraph, generate a paragraph form gen ai and compare it
