# LANG2030 
- There are two assessment:
    - two group presentations:
        - one with individual analytical report 
        - the other one is group report


## Engineering ethics




## Rules of the engineers 
- they does not apply to non-engineers i.e. people without a license of being a engineer


# WFEO
- we will be using them for the report and presentations



# laws and rules 
- do not confuse laws and rules
- if an engineer fails some sort of codes, it applies only to the engineer. Not the company or other stakeholders 
  - so we can't say that "the company fails the code of ethics"

# homework 1
- turn the code of ethics formal language to spoken language number 1 and 2
