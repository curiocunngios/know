# Digital Logic Circuit example:
  - A circuit with two inputs (A, B) and two outputs (S, C)
  - The circuit executes as follows 
    - S is true if exactly one input is true;
    - C is true if both two inputs are true.
  - Describe the behaviour of the circuit with truth table and logic 
function
  - Build the circuit with logic gates
  - What is the circuit for?
