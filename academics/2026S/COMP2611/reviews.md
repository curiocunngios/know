## Content

其實文科黎, 如果背到書其實唔難

BIN/DEC/HEX 進制轉換
Logic (logic gates, K-maps, PLA, linear algebra of logic equations)
Sequential Logic (SR-latch, D latch, clock, D flip-flop)
整數/小數二進制表達 (2's complement/ IEEE754)

** MIPS Programming
CPU Performance 計算
ALU (CPU點做加減乘除)

** Processor (singlepath/ multipath)
Piipeline
Memory Hierarchy

## Teaching

Cindy教得幾好, 尤其上堂畫既圖解, 睇lecture video都差唔多明哂
Tutorial同lab好多都冇上

## Grading

15% Assignment x2
15% Programming Project
30% Midterm x2 (兩個midterm.....)
40% Final

Assignment 1 mean 44.3/50
Assignment 2 mean 45.5/50
Project mean 103.7/120
midterm 1 mean 68.9
midterm 2 mean 65
final mean 77.9

overall 86.8 + Bonus 3/3 (Project有bonus part) B, ~90 - 93 B+, 93.X A-

個mean其實唔係咁高 得7成幾... 94先有A range...

## Workload

睇哂lecture video就差唔多明哂, 教既野唔難, assignment唔辛苦, program project本身分開幾日做都唔chur, 然而deadline fighter最後先發現COMP2012 PA3同一日deadline... 四日做兩份PA輕鬆 :D

除左上堂/睇lecture video之外都冇乜workload

## Summary
- just memorize
- the cutoff for A range is very high


# KF8311

## Content

The course is quite discrete, and the content are not connected well
4 Major parts:
1. Logic Gates, IEEE754, Data Representation etc
2. MIPS Programming
======= Midterm =======
3. ALU and Processor (also Pipeline Process)
4. Memory System (Cache and Virtual Memory)
======= Final =======
(Virtual memory is not tested in final exam tho :0 )
Despite the fact that they stated that the exams are cumulative but actually the final focus on the latter part

Tbh, I can hardly catch up with the content and need to frequently ask Cindy/ TAs to solve my enquiries. These topics are barely connected as the things are shallow and wide.

So, shall we talk about this?

## Teaching

Cindy is fine in 2611, just her accent is a bit (not too much) hard to understand, she is willing to spend time with students to explain content after class and open to student who ask question.
But the explanation in the lecture is not very clear and thus the attendance rate of the lecture dwindled eventually.

Tutorials are fine. Gary can deliver the tutorial materials clearly and the practice are actually useful for revision

I never go the labs since logisim are not tested in final/midterm :DDDDD so no comment for labs

## Grading

Homework: 15% (4 HWs combined)
Programming assignment 15%
Midterm 30%
Final 40%
(PA Bonus: 2.25% for completing bonus task 6-7 in PA, Cindy stated that it will not be calculated in the curve, and will only make your grade higher or the same)

Will update score here when I get the stat  
These are before appeal, the real one should be slightly higher  
Midterm:  
Average: 62.22  
SD: 17.41  
Median: 65  
Max: 99  
Quite tough (time is quite constrained)  

Final  
Mean: 68.48  
SD: 19.56  
Median: 71.5  

Me:  
Homework: 48/50,48/50,50/50,49.5/50  
PA: 115/100 (15 is converted to 2.25% bonus)  
Midterm: 72/100  
Final: 91/100  
Overall: 89.91% (/w bonus)  
Grade: A-  
I am depressed for missing 0.1% from A :<< so the grading C is a bit biased but anyway  
the mean is so mean  
為什麼 為什麼要給這種壞心眼的Grade!!!  

90% overall is guaranteed an A grade or above for Cindy's 2611 (stated and mentioned many times during lectures and piazza)
(why this sounds a bit Dekai)

The exam was held in 12/10 9:30-11:30 but they release the final exam mark this morning and have paper checking tmr :skull: ... (12/11 10 am) Crazy efficiency (slightly slower than MATH2411) for a course with 140 students (although they have like 10 TAs)
Midterm only 90mins I screw up since insufficient time
Final 2 hours which is better
So I have finished my final exam
I remember the composition is like this:
1. MCs
Hardest part is here bruh, do LQs first  
2. MIPS
Moderately hard  
3. MIPS (recursion but translate MIPS to C++)
this is a reference to COMP2012 Lab 6, thank you
4. ALU
Read the logic gates carefully
5. MIPS -> Processor (also single cycle single path)
Actually tough
明就明唔明就何漢明
(if you know you know if you don't u [del/] Ho Hon Ming [/del] don't)
6. More single-cycle signal paths
Trivial
7. Pipeline Process
Standard and trivial
8. Cache
Standard but I forgot *4 for size  
Advised to revise more single cycle data paths and ALU, important
and marking is relatively lenient and have partial credits

## Workload

No attendance needed
Homework not too hard, takes me 2-3 hours each
Programming assignment is moderately challenging and if you want to get the bonus task it requires extra dedication.
This year the PA is Super Mario Bros, quite interesting and I have seen many crazy works by my peers which add many new mechanics
My work is rather simple, but I still get full mark for that

## Content

建议学Berkeley的CS61C，同样是计租，2611的内容只有别人的一半。
不过slide比较精美，T堂和lab比较有用。

## Teaching

Alex Lam纯正的加🇨🇦美🇺🇸口音，听着很舒服很流畅，课下也可以三语沟通，人很nice。
他还教cyber课，所以他讲计组的时候有时会用cyber的角度来解释一些东西的优劣，很有意思。
而且他一节课的分配大概是前半小时会复习上一节课的内容，衔接做的很好。

## Grading

hw 15%，PA 15%, midterm 30%, final 40%
hw和PA只要仔细就可以几乎满分。
midterm和final风格一样，选择+大题，考的很细节，考试分数的分布属于方差很小，容错率很低的那种。因为他考的不难，需要仔细。
midterm成绩86/100, mean: 74.58, median: 76, high: 100, uq: 86
final成绩85/100, mean 66.67, median 69.5, high 100, uq 81
overall成绩89.58/100, mean 76.05, median 79.54, high 99.6, uq 85.85

最后overall就比uq高了4分，但是拿了A。感觉这种情况应该A-才符合comp课。

## Workload

每节课都认真听，课后积极消化问问题，作业认真完成，lab不是必做（不grade），唯一一个PA也只需要两个下午就能搞定。感觉在comp课中workload算小的。不过lab比较难，如果要grade lab就会比较难受。
