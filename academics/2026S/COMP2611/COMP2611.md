    - Roughly releasing in week 3, 5, 8, 11
    - due in one or two weeks
  - Midterm exam (30%) 
    - March 20 (Friday) 7:00pm, LTA & LTG, week 7
  - 1 individual programming project (15%)
    - Roughly to be released in week 9
    - due in one month (last day of Spring term)
  - Final exam (40%)
    - mid/late May

- ### Rough course schedule:
  - week 3: homework 1
  - week 4: Tutorial and lab starts
  - week 5: homework 2
  - week 7: Midterm (Mar 20 7pm)
  - week 8: Homework 3 
  - Week 9: PA release
  - Week 11: Homework 4 
- ### Academic Integrity:
  - Course homework and project should be individual work
- ### What does the course teach:
  - How does a computer work internally
  - How can we get electricity to somehow add two numbers
  - What happens when programs are executed by the computer
  - How do we design programming languages and hardware to work together
  - How do we make computer faster
- ### Learning outcomes
  - Understand [digital logic](../../../notes/digital_logic.md) and how to build small circuits involved in computer systems
  - Able to describe the interaction between software and hardware as well as the [(ISA) Instruction Set Architecture](../../../notes/ISA.md)
  - Write and execute a small program of a few hundred lines of [assembly language](../../../notes/assembly.md)
  - Define the basic concepts of computer hardware, including processor(datapath, control) and memory
  - Describe the organizational paradigms that determine the capability and performance of computer systems
- ### Topics
  - Brief digital circuit
    - Topic 1: Digital logic (combinational and sequential) 
  - Data representation and arithmetic
    - Topic 2: Data representation (integer, fractional, character)
    - Topic 3: Computer arithmetic (Addition, subtraction, multipliation, division) and ALU
  - ISA and assembly
    - Topic 4: ISA and MIPS Assembly Language   
  - Computer Architecture
    - Topic 5: Processor (datapath and control) and pipeline 
    - Topic 6: Memory system (cache, virtual memory)

## Introduction:
- ### Common number system
  - A **number system** defines how numbers can be represented using distinct symbols
  - A number can be represented differently in different systems:
    - For example, $(2A)_{16}$ and $(101010)_{2}$ both equals to $(42)_{10}$
- ### Positional Notation 
  - Each digit position has an associated weight:
    > $642_{(10)} = 6 \times 10^{2} + 4 \times 10^{1} + 2 \times 10^{0}$
  - As formula
    > $d_{n - 1} \times R^{n - 1} + d_{n - 2} \times R^{n - 2} + ... + d_{1} \times R^{1} + d_{0} \times R^{0}$
    - where `d` stands for digits and `R` stands for radix (base)
- ### Common number system:
|System|Base|Symbols|Remark|
|------|----|-------|------|
|Decimal|10|0, 1, ..., 9| Used by people|
|Binary|2|0, 1| Used by digital computers|
|Hexadecimal|16|0, 1, ... 9, A, B, ... F| Great way to concisely represent a binary sequence|

- ### Binary (base 2)
  - Used to model the series of computer signals computers use to represent information
  - **Base 2**
    - two symbols:
      - `0, 1`
      - binary digits
      - also known as "bits"
      - A sequence of bits (bit sequence) usually work together (?)
- ### Classes of computer
  - Personal computers
    - General purpose, variety of software
    - Subject to cost/performance trade-off
  - Server computers
    - Network based
    - high capacity, performance, reliability
    - Range from small servers to building sized 
  - Super computers
    - high-end scientific and engineering calculations
    - Highest capability but represent a small fraction of the computer market
  - Embedded computers
    - Hidden as components of systems
    -  Stringent power/performance/cost constraints
- ### Below a computer program:
  - Application software
    - written in high-level language
  - System software
    - Compiler: Translates HLL code to machine code
  - Operating system: Service code
    - Handling input/output
    - Managing memory and storage
    - Scheduling tasks & sharing resources
  - Hardware
    - Processor, memory, I/O controllers

- ### Levels of program code
  - High-level language
    - level of abstraction closer to problem domain (?)
  - Provides for productivity and portability
  - Assembly language:
    - Textural representations of instructions
    - Symbolic language
  - Hardware representation 
    - Binary digits (bits)
    - Encoded instructions and data
- ### Levels of abstraction
  - both hardware and software are organized in hierarchical layers
    - which helps to cope with system complexity
  - lower level details are **hidden** to offer a simpler view at the higher levels
  - Interaction between levels occurs through well-defined **interface**
    - Interface between hardware and software: ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
